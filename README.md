## About the course

> This course teaches students how to use machine learning techniques and tools for predictive analytics. 
> The course will also teach students to: specify problems accessible with these methods, evaluate analytics models, use new tools in the rapidly evolving automated machine learning field, and deploy machine learning models. 
> The course assumes prior experience with: basic probability theory, traditional statistics for categorical and continuous independent variables, introductory Python programming.

## Course content:


> * Predictive Analytics with Machine Learning
> * Supervised learning: Classification and Regression
> * Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and dimensionality reductions.
> * Tuning ML algorithms via python scikit-learn
> * Automated ML tools.
> * Business Applications of Machine Learning.



## Business applications:
>
> Useful applications of Machine Learning:
> * **Customer Segmentation and Targeting:**
>
> Application: ML models analyze customer data (behavior, demographics, purchase history) to group customers into segments based on similarities. 
> Enables personalized marketing strategies, improving customer engagement and conversion rates.
> * **Predictive Analytics:** 
>
> Using historical data, ML algorithms can predict future outcomes such as demand forecasting, customer churn, or financial market trends.
> Supports strategic planning, inventory management, and risk mitigation.
> 
> * **Fraud Detection and Security:**
> 
> ML models identify unusual patterns in transactions or behaviors that may indicate fraudulent activity or cybersecurity threats.
>  Reduces financial losses due to fraud and improves security measures.
>
> * **Healthcare Applications:**
> 
> In healthcare, ML is used for predictive diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, medical imaging analysis, and drug discovery.
> Improves patient outcomes, reduces costs, and accelerates research and development.
> 
> * **Financial Services**
> 
> Businesses use ML to analyze customer needs, market trends, and competitive landscapes, helping in the development of new products or features.
> Drives innovation, reduces time-to-market, and increases the chances of product success.
